Kraid|Kraid was a boss in the original NES game, along with Ridley. He is considerably larger than before, taking up the space of two vertical screens. Although many players speculated that Kraid somehow grew since the first game, Metroid: Zero Mission has since retconned Kraid to have a consistent size between games. Outside Kraid's chamber, a seemingly fresh human corpse is found. Although the identity has never been revealed, the body resembles a Galactic Federation Marine.
Phantoon|Phantoon is a ghostly flying creature who taps into Mother Brain's brainwaves and feeds off the Wrecked Ship's energy supply. Unlike most bosses which are fought at or near the end of a level, Phantoon must be defeated before the rest of the Wrecked Ship may be explored.
Draygon|Draygon is an enormous sea creature that resides in Maridia. Its hard armor-like shell provides it with a great amount of defensive strength and it is guarded by several Wall Cannons. Draygon has a weak point - a very open and soft belly. One way to exploit this is for Samus to get caught in its gummy spit on purpose and let it grab her, then use the Grapple Beam to latch on to a broken cannon. If she continues to grapple, the electricity will conduct through her and into Draygon, killing it easily.
Ridley|Ridley, the monster whom Samus fought in the original NES game, makes his comeback as one of the most difficult bosses in the game. He is responsible for the bloodbath at Ceres Space Station and the kidnapping of the Metroid hatchling.
Mother Brain|The final boss, this entity is a supercomputer resembling a disembodied brain in a tank protected by deadly Rinka laser rings, automated defense cannons, and self-regenerating organic life support conduits. When it is down, a new mechanical body rises out of the floor, allowing Mother Brain to move. After the second defeat, Zebes' final Countdown begins.
